"""
Release-candidate post-processor: the two bounded remedies the release
gate's failures call for, applied to an already-generated synthetic CSV
without retraining anything.

    python postprocess_candidate.py --file output/generate/DT4H_Synthetic_tvae_seed0.csv \
        [--model output/generate/models/tvae_seed0.pkl] [--out <path>] \
        [--no-snap] [--no-filter]

  1. GRANULARITY SNAP: numeric values are rounded onto each column's
     empirical grid (integer ages and blood pressures, one-decimal
     weights), inferred from the decoded training split. Cosmetic by
     measurement (C2ST unchanged in the ablation), but gives released
     records face validity.
  2. NEAREST-RECORD REJECTION FILTER: records closer to a training
     record than the holdout p5 threshold -- the distance criterion the
     gate enforces -- are dropped. With --model, replacements are drawn
     from the saved generator (same post-processing chain as the
     pipeline) until the target row count is restored or --max-rounds
     is exhausted; without it, the output is simply smaller.

DP runs (run id containing 'eps') are REFUSED: the rejection filter is
data-dependent post-processing against the training data, which voids
the differential-privacy guarantee the run exists for. --force-dp
overrides with a loud warning; the output then carries no DP claim.

The output is re-audited (representation, leakage in decoded space,
distance re-check) and written next to the input as
<name>_postprocessed.csv (or --out). It is a NEW release candidate:
run release_gate.py on it, and treat its fidelity as changed -- the
filter deliberately trades marginal fidelity for distance margin, and
the evaluate step quantifies that honestly if pointed at the file.
