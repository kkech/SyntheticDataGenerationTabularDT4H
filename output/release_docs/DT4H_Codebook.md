# DT4H UC1 Synthetic Dataset -- Codebook

Generated 2026-09-17 by the pipeline. One row per released column. Ranges and category lists are aggregate facts over the training split (also published in the profiling reports). **A null is never 'unknown noise' in this dataset -- its meaning is stated per column.**

Numeric ranges below are **coarsened for disclosure control**: each min/max is rounded outward (min down, max up) to 2 significant figures, so a published endpoint is never an exact single-patient value while still bounding the true range.
