Step: evaluate

Measures distribution distance between the stages of the pipeline:

  * original      -- the raw loaded dataset (output/load_data/);
  * preprocessed  -- the full training frame, sentinels decoded;
  * train/holdout -- the 75/25 split of the preprocessed frame; the
                     generators only ever saw the train side;
  * synthetic     -- every DT4H_Synthetic_*.csv the generate step wrote.

Comparisons, each answering a different question:

  original vs preprocessed  did preprocessing distort the data it kept?
                            (should be ~zero on every untouched column)
  train vs holdout          the SAMPLING-NOISE FLOOR: two disjoint
                            samples of real patients differ by this much
                            purely by chance. No synthesizer can honestly
                            beat this; how close each gets to it is the
                            calibrated fidelity result.
  train vs synthetic        fidelity to what the generator was trained on
                            (the headline number, read against the floor)
  holdout vs synthetic      generalization: distance to real data the
                            generator never saw.

The 38 constant columns the generate step re-attaches verbatim are
EXCLUDED from all aggregates: they are copies, not modelling successes,
and would flatter every model equally.

MATCHED-SIZE SCORING: the floor is only exchangeable with comparisons
at the same (n_a, n_b). KS-type two-sample statistics concentrate
toward zero as sample sizes grow, so a floor computed at
(n_train, n_holdout) read against full-size train-vs-synthetic runs
(n_train vs n_train) would make the floor look ~40% looser than the
comparisons it calibrates. Every train-vs-synthetic comparison --
marginals, subgroup fidelity, association deltas, C2ST -- therefore
subsamples the synthetic frame to the holdout's row count with seeds
derived from config.seed (marginals average three seeded draws;
association profiling and C2ST use one draw, repeats being too costly
there). Holdout-vs-synthetic needs no draw: KS at (n, m) has the same
null distribution as at (m, n), so it already sits on the floor's
geometry.

Runs sharing a (model, epsilon) are aggregated across seeds as
mean +/- sd, and DP models get an epsilon-sweep view.

Writes JSON detail plus one Markdown overview to output/evaluate/.
Aggregate statistics only -- safe to commit.
