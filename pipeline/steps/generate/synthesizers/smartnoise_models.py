"""
Differentially private synthesizers from OpenDP smartnoise-synth.

Two families, and the choice between them matters:

  * Marginal-based (AIM, MST, PATE-CTGAN's cousins): measure noisy
    low-dimensional marginals under DP and fit a graphical model to them.
    Utility-oriented benchmarks consistently report these OUTPERFORMING
    DP-GANs on tabular data -- at moderate epsilon, AIM has been reported
    close to real-data utility. AIM is workload-aware and generally beats
    MST, especially at higher epsilon. These are CPU-only: there is no
    GPU training to speed up.

  * DP-GAN (DPCTGAN): the deep-learning route. Included for comparison
    with the project's original approach, but the literature suggests it
    is the weaker choice for tabular data.

SCALING CAVEAT: AIM and MST both build on Private-PGM, which is documented
to struggle as the column count grows, in both fitting and sampling. This
dataset has ~329 columns, which is squarely in the risky range. Use
`max_columns` to trial a subset before committing to a full run, and fall
back to MST (cheaper, pairwise-tree-based) if AIM will not fit in memory.

WHERE THE NUMERIC BOUNDS COME FROM (this is the privacy-critical part)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
snsynth needs a [lower, upper] domain per continuous column. Preprocessing
that domain out of the training data -- what this module used to do, with
`preprocessor_eps=0.0` and lo/hi taken from `df.min()/df.max()` -- is a
formal DP violation: the released mechanism then depends on private
records through an unnoised channel, so no epsilon claim holds. It is
also the classic silent one: nothing crashes, the summary still prints an
epsilon, and the guarantee is simply not there.

The bounds are now A PRIORI PUBLIC and human-reviewed. `public_domains.json`
(template written by make_public_domains.py, reviewed and signed off by a
human setting `reviewed: true`) declares [lo, hi] per numeric column. DP
fitting REFUSES to start if that file is missing or unreviewed -- the guard
exists so a formally-invalid campaign cannot be launched by accident.

Sentinel-encoded columns need one extra step. Preprocessing replaced every
numeric null with a per-column sentinel placed BELOW the observed range:

    sentinel = min_observed - max(0.25 * (max_observed - min_observed), 1.0)

so the training frame contains values below the public `lo`. The bound
passed to snsynth for such a column is therefore

    [pub_lo - max(0.25 * (pub_hi - pub_lo), 1.0),  pub_hi]

which is a PURE FUNCTION OF THE PUBLIC DOMAIN -- it mirrors the data-side
formula with public numbers substituted for private ones. Because a
reviewed public domain must contain the observed range (pub_lo <=
min_observed, pub_hi >= max_observed), this public sentinel is always <=
the data sentinel, so every training value lands inside the public bound.
That containment is asserted at fit time against the actual frame, so a
too-narrow reviewed range fails in seconds instead of after hours of
fitting. The check reads private data, but only to abort: it releases
nothing and produces no output when it fires. Columns without a sentinel
entry simply get [pub_lo, pub_hi].

REMAINING CAVEATS, to be disclosed rather than papered over:

  * CATEGORICAL VOCABULARIES ARE STILL PRIVATE. snsynth's LabelTransformer
    learns each categorical column's category list from the training data,
    at zero epsilon. This is standard practice in the DP-synthesis
    literature and in snsynth's own defaults, but it is a real leak: the
    presence of a rare category is disclosed by the fact that the model
    can emit it. Declaring public vocabularies would close it; until then
    it belongs in the release documentation.
  * THE TRAINING VALUES ARE DATA-DERIVED, and that is fine. The sentinel
    encoding is a transform of private values, not a released statistic;
    DP requires the BOUNDS (the mechanism's parameters) to be public, not
    the inputs.
  * AIM's column selection (see column_selection.py) is computed on the
    train split without noise, so width-limited AIM runs carry a
    data-dependent choice of which columns exist at all.
