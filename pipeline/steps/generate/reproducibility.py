Provenance capture for publication.

A synthetic dataset submitted to a journal has to be reproducible from the
paper alone: same seed, same library versions, same code revision, same
inputs. This module records exactly that, so every generated file can be
traced back to the conditions that produced it.

    Seeds every RNG the synthesizers draw from. Returns what was set, so
    the summary records it rather than relying on the config being
    unchanged afterwards.

    Note the honest limitation: seeding makes a run reproducible on the
    same hardware and library versions, but GPU kernels are not always
    bit-deterministic across driver/hardware changes, so exact
    reproduction on different hardware is not guaranteed.

    PYTHONHASHSEED is deliberately NOT set here. Setting it at runtime is
    a no-op: CPython fixes the hash seed at interpreter start-up, so
    assigning the environment variable from inside the process changes
    nothing and only creates the impression that set iteration order is
    pinned. It matters only when the LAUNCHER exports it
    (`PYTHONHASHSEED=0 python main.py`) and only for code that iterates
    over a set or dict built from set operations. The pipeline's own
    order-sensitive spot -- the AIM column selection -- now sorts its
    inputs explicitly (see column_selection.py), which is the durable
    fix; the env var is a launcher-level belt to that braces.
