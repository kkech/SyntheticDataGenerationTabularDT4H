Step: attacks

Adversarial privacy evaluation -- the DCR analysis (privacy step) bounds
record-copying; this step actively ATTACKS each synthetic dataset and
reports how well the attacks do. The holdout split makes both attacks
honest: training members and unseen non-members are real patients from
the same distribution.

  * MEMBERSHIP INFERENCE (distance attack): the attacker scores each
    real record by its distance to the nearest synthetic record and
    predicts "was in the training set" for close ones. Reported as the
    attack's AUC over train (members) vs holdout (non-members); 0.5 =
    the synthetic data reveals nothing about who was trained on. A
    bootstrap interval says whether an AUC above 0.5 is even
    distinguishable from noise.
  * ATTRIBUTE INFERENCE: an attacker who knows a patient's
    quasi-identifiers (age, gender, admission year) looks up the most
    similar synthetic records and infers a sensitive attribute. The
    honest headline is the MEMBERSHIP ADVANTAGE: attack accuracy on
    training members minus accuracy on unseen holdout patients. Any
    population-level inference (both accuracies above baseline, equally)
    is the intended purpose of releasing data; only member-specific
    advantage is leakage.

If the `anonymeter` package is installed, its singling-out and
linkability evaluators run as well; otherwise they are skipped with a
note (the two native attacks above are the primary evidence).

Aggregate statistics only -- safe to commit.
