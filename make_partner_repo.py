"""
Export the partner-facing copy of this pipeline into a clean folder.

    python make_partner_repo.py                 # -> ../SyntheticDataGenerationTabularDT4H
    python make_partner_repo.py --dest /path/to/SyntheticDataGenerationTabularDT4H
    python make_partner_repo.py --check-only    # verify a previous export, copy nothing

The destination is the tree partners clone and run at their own site
(README: `python main.py --data-dir /their/extract`). It is built
ALLOWLIST-FIRST: only the code and the declared public metadata are
copied; everything else -- output/, logs, status, backups, the paper,
this repo's .git -- never leaves the dev repo, so nothing derived from
patient data can ship by accident.

Re-runnable by design: each run refreshes the allowlisted files in place
and NEVER touches the destination's own .git, so `git init` there once,
re-export after every campaign, and commit the diff.

Transforms applied to the copy (the dev repo is never modified):
  * public_domains.json -- observed_min/observed_max are DELETED from
    every entry. They are exact values of real patients, kept in the dev
    repo only to aid the human review; lo/hi/basis are the public
    declaration and are all a partner site needs.
  * pipeline/config.py -- the dev enclave's transfer path is replaced by
    a placeholder; partners point the pipeline at their extract with
    --data-dir anyway.

After copying, a verification sweep greps the export for anything that
must not be there (patient-data file types, enclave hostnames and names,
unscrubbed observed extremes) and exits non-zero if it finds any.
